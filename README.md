# Twitter Broadcast Downloader ui

This is a fork of https://github.com/offish/twitter-broadcast-downloader except I added a UI to it.

Absolutely nothing else is special about it. Go there and read their ReadMe for better details.

## Installation
```
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```
FFMPEG is also required and has to be added to path.
